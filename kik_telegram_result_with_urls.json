As confirmed by early leaks, here is good old MagSafe, similar to the one in the 2015 MacBook Pro, as well as an SD card slot and a full HDMI port. And no Touch Bar - who didn't believe that?\n\nThe bezels on the sides and top edge are only 3.5 mm.

Peak 1600 nits.\n\nThe front-facing camera is similar to the one found in the new iMac 24: 1080p and video conferencing is amazing (if your internet connection is, of course).\n\nThe speakers promise us top-end ones. The 16-inch laptop produces 80% more bass than the old gearbox. Also included are Dolby Atmos, Spatial Audio and \"studio quality\" microphones.\n\nThe new \"firmware\" is twice as powerful as the previous 16-inch MacBook Pro on i9. Graphics are 2.5 times more powerful, ML is five times more powerful. The 14-inch version is 3.7 times more powerful than the i7 version, and the graphics are 19 times more powerful! And the thing is that the performance of both laptops is the same.\n\nThe maximum video memory is 16 GB. The maximum amount of a single memory is 64 GB. SSD speed - 7.4 GB / s.\n\nThe 14-inch version has 17 hours of video playback, while the 16-inch version has 21 hours.
